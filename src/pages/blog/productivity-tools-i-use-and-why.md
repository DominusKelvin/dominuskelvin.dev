## The Why
The tools listed here are tools that I use and I've found them to be really valuable for certain tasks.

A big factor for me to choose a tool to boost productivity is simplicity. By **simplicity** I mean: **how easy it is to do stuff with this tool**.

I also like tools that act like tools - something you reach for when you need it to carry out a particular function. I don't like tools that want attention every time.


## The tools

### [Calendly](https://calendly.com)
This is a no-brainer for scheduling. It has made scheduling [TKYT](/tkyt) sessions and one-on-one a breeze. I love it!

### [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com)
This is gold for technical writing or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin) ðŸ˜€. I use it as a browser extension.

### [1Password](https://1password.com)
Password management has never been easier!

### [Zapier](https://zapier.com)

A life-saver for me, this one. I can set up automation to create a Todoist task when someone schedules a TKYT session so I don't necessarily have to check Calendly.

Also any time a schedule is made on my Google Calendar I get a task created on Todoist!

### [FeedHive](feedhive.io)

I love this tool for scheduling tweets and posts for LinkedIn. It also enables me to not have to open the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin) app every time!

### [Krisp](https://krisp.ai)

Krisp removes background noise from my screencasts and TKYT sessions. I don't know how it does it but it's like magic!

## [Todoist](https://todoist.com)

Easily my frequently open tool. I use it to have an overview of the things I want to do everyday.
