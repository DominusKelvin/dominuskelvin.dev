**October 8th, 2024** will mark exactly 4 years since I penned my thoughts [on learning React](/blog/on-learning-react).

Throughout this time, React has continued its ascent, cementing its position as the go-to technology for declarative user interface development on the web.

With this ascent however, there has not been any shortage with the complexities in building full-stack or even client-only apps in the React ecosystem.

From state management challenges to the various methods of data fetching—now recognized as a distinct issue—along with the new trend of React Server Components and outsourcing authentication and authorization to third-party SaaS, the list of complexities keeps piling up.

Yet, even with these intricacies, I can't overlook the elegance and user-friendliness of JSX that React popularized - though I had to learn to tolerate the `className` mishap.

Not only is it beautiful, but it's also portable, as the API presents itself as familiar JavaScript functions—and I love JavaScript functions.

Additionally, React's approach to conditional rendering, iterations, and event handling increasingly resembles JavaScript.

All of these pique my interest, but whenever I encounter a state management solution or consider the full-stack story with something like Next or Remix, my interest fades.

## React is not the problem

I got to ponder more on my newly found love/hate relationship with React when I had to work on [Mellow React](https://x.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1838173026270982622) - The full-stack starter template for [The Boring JavaScript Stack](https://docs.sailscasts.com/boring-stack).

Then I had an epiphany: **React was never the problem**. It was never too complex; the complexity came from the other technologies or concepts added to React to make it do full-stack or build Single Page Applications.

Using React in The Boring JavaScript Stack was ideal for me. It focuses on **vanilla React** without complex state management or client-side routing, avoiding the extra layers added by the [Merchants of Complexity](https://world.hey.com/dhh/merchants-of-complexity-4851301b) that make React challenging.

## My perfect React dosage

My perfect React dosage is using React as a declarative language for authoring UIs - vanilla React.

Removing all the bells and whistles of "modern" web development complexities and pairing React with [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) - the tiny routing library that makes The Boring Stack possible - truly makes React shine for me, and I love it.

That's my limit; anything more feels like an overdose. From what I've seen online, it's excessive for most people. Why don't we all adjust our React usage to a comfortable level, as I have?

I plan to test out this React dose of mine by building more full-stack JavaScript applications using React. In fact, I plan to build **25 full-stack JavaScript products** with React under the umbrella of my course: [Build 50 Products in 50 Days](https://sailcasts.com/project-50).

That should be exactly 25 reasons why vanilla React is fun to author UI in, and I can't wait to share my findings after that as well. Stay tuned!

## Levelling up on my React

With this React dosage of mine, it means the surface area of concepts and techniques I have to learn to master React has been greatly reduced to its essence.

Because of that, I'll be taking [Kent C. Dodds'](https://x.com/kentcdodds) [Epic React v2](https://www.epicreact.dev/) course as I want to write the best React possible for the [Build 50 Products in 50 Days](https://sailscasts.com/project-50) course and also improve the free starter templates for The Boring JavaScript Stack.

Here is to finding your perfect dosage for the tools you use!
