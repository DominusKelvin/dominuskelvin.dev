Hello there, so I was having a bit of light reading and I stumbled on an interview of Nathan Barry(the creator of ConvertKit).
The interview left me in awe and prompted me to up my game with the [Sailscasts](https://sailscasts.com) project. Hence the challenge:

> Launch Sailscasts on March 17th, 2021 with a recurring revenue of 5,000 USD/month

I am really excited about this challenge and I am willing to put in the work. Here is why:

I believe Sailscasts will be of value to both the Solo entrepreneur looking at launching that next big idea on the web and also help developers serve their employers better. Sailscasts will be the go-to place to learn Node.js and Sails.

I really want this to be in the hands of potential developers it might help out soonest. Hence I would be working it out for the next 6 months(starting from today).

## Want to help?

I hope to be writing an article along the line: **Launched Sailscasts!** soonest.

Until next time, let me get busy bringing Sailscasts to the world.
