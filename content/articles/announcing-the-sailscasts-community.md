I announced some time ago on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1302614636227956736?s=20) that I will be building [Sailscasts](https://sailscasts.com) - a platform targeted at helping server-side JavaScript developers build out their ideas in the [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com) Node.js framework. [Read](/blog/introducing-sailscasts) more about Sailscasts.

Prior to the launch of the Sailscasts platform, I created a Discord server where developers new to Sails.js can get help on their questions about Sails.js. Also available are channels for Node.js, Vue.js, amongst other fun channels.

When we are together we learn and grow faster. Join the Sailscasts community, I will be stoked to bid you welcome in there.

P.S: Interested in learning Sails.js from the Sailscasts platform? [Join](https://sailscasts.com) the wait-list and you will be the first to know when it launches.

As always, you can [tweet](https://twitter.com/dominus_kelvin) at me on Twitter your thoughts on this article.

Code expressively ðŸŽ¨, <br /> Kelvin
