Hello there. I recently announced in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1302614636227956736?s=20) that I will be working on an exclusive online platform for learning Sails.js and backend JavaScript. This article is to resound why I decided to work on the project.

## The inspiration
I strongly believe JavaScript is an empowering language and more developers could easily build out their ideas with JavaScript from UI to web services. However, I noticed there is a gap in getting adequate resources and a all in one spot to get the knowledge-base you need while building out your ideas in NodeJS/JavaScript. Sailscasts will help bridge that gap by providing quality ready to use and apply concepts ranging from:

* Architectures
* Best practices
* Automated testings
* Deployments and scaling
* and so much more...

It's a project I feel strongly about and I am committing the next six months to bringing it to fruition. I will be [tweeting](https://twitter.com/dominus_kelvin) and writing on the journey as it goes on.

You can also subscribe for the early-bird list [here](https://sailscast.com) for sneak peaks on the development process as well as bonuses when the project launches.

P.S: You can follow [@sails_casts](https://twitter.com/sails_casts) on twitter for updates as well.

Code expressively ðŸŽ¨, <br /> Kelvin
