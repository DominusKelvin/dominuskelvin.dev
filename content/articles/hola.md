I finally did it ðŸŽ‰. For years I have been procrastinating maintaining my own blog. I finally pulled it off and it feels so good.

I plan on sharing my experience as a software engineer in here and also helpful tips and tricks for developers related to technologies that interest me.

This very first post is my idea of the conventional 'hello world' so bear with me. You can let me know what you want me to write about on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dominus_kelvin).

I would also provide a newsletter so you can get notify when I write new articles.

Expect great things from this side of the web soonest!

Code expressively ðŸš€ ðŸš€, <br /> Kelvin
